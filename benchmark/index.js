/* 

Benchmarking Plans:

ESBench doesn't support my entire iife :(

So we'll have to roll our own.

Use rollup plugin serve, and just make a simple Preact component page.

Similar to Assemblyscript docz, and AMP localhost :)

Definitly use benchmarkJS. And then use the microtime for our performance.

Find some lightweight charting lib.

Deploy all this, as well as alternative demos to wasmboy.app. Under subdirectories.
