<!--- Short Description-->

🎮👾🕹️ Gameboy Emulator Library written in Web Assembly using [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript), Debugger/Shell in Preact 🎮👾🕹️

**Project is still < 1.0.0. Most games are playable, but the emulator is still not very accurate. Expect bugs.**

# Features

- Emulates the Gameboy / Gameboy Color 🎮👾🕹️
- Outputs graphics to a scalable / responsive HTML5 canvas 🖼️, and audio through the Web Audio API 🔊
- Support for In-game saves, and save states 💾
- Configurable options to increase performance for low(er) end devices 🔥
- Importable into other projects as a dependency ♻️
- Built with Web Assembly 🕸️
- Uses Web Workers for parallelized rendering 🛠️
- Keyboard and gamepad input support using [responsive gamepad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-gamepad) ⌨️ 🎮
- Debugger with a value table (I/O map), Tile Data visualizer, and Background Map with Scroll Indicators 🐛
- Runs in both Browser and Node 🌐

# Usage

**Project is still < 1.0.0. Most games are playable, but the emulator is still not very accurate. Expect bugs.**

Simply install through npm:

`npm install --save wasmboy`

Documentation for the project can be found on the [WasmBoy Wiki](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy/wiki).

### Supported Platforms

Try to test and aim for support on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Also, Node support works with the [`headless` option in the WasmBoy config](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy/wiki/Lib-API#wasmboyoptions), and using the [Worker Threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) `--experimental-worker` flag.

### Installation

Just your standard node app. Install Node with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), `git clone` the project, and `npm install`, and you should be good to go!

### CLI Commands / Npm Scripts

The project contains three different elements.

- The `debugger` is the container for the wasmboy library, which is simply a [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) application, generated with [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).
- The `core` or `wasm` which is the web assembly module for wasmboy written in [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
- The `lib` which is the importable library of wasmboy that can be used in other projects, that adds a top level API to the `core`.

Each of these uses a different build process. The debugger uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), the wasm uses the [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiler CLI tool, and the lib uses [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en).

Commands for each part of the project will be prepended with their element name and a colon, e.g `debugger:[command here]`.

Commands not prepended with a colon are meant for easily building on all of the different parts as a whole.

```bash
# Command to serve the project, and watch the debugger, wasm, and lib for changes
# Uses concurrently: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently
# Concurrently helps cleanup the output and organizes all three watchers/servers
npm start

# Same as npm start
npm run dev

# Same as npm start
npm run watch

# Build the wasm module and the lib to be ready to be pushed to npm or released
npm run build

# Run tests in `test/accuracy/test.js`
npm run test

# Run tests in `test/performance/test.js`
npm run test:performance

# Watch the debugger (preact) project for changes and livereload
npm run debugger:watch

# Build the debugger (preact) project and serve it
npm run debugger:serve

# Build the debugger (preact) project
npm run debugger:build

# Watch the wasm (AssemblyScript) *.ts files and build on changes
npm run core:watch

# Build the wasm (AssemblyScript) *.ts files, with the correct CLI flags
npm run core:build

# Watch the Wasmboy ES6 Module for changes, and build
npm run lib:watch

# Build the WasmBoy Es6 module
npm run lib:build
```

The debugger application/container for wasmboy utilizes the [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md). Additional workflow commands and tips can be found there.
